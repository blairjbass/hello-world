N00B repository to learn

My original educational background was in Math/CS (my undergrad).  I since moved on to a finance field but want to get back into that Math/CS intersection.  I am taking up data science/anaylsis as a hobby and maybe as a future career pivot.  I am taking the Johns Hopkins certicate MOOC to keep me on track for a few months to learn the basics.
